# Glimpse of the Future

The Glimpse of the Future is a Python based text game, deployed with a mock terminal provided by Code Institute, using Heroku.

The main inspirations for this game are Fortune Tellers and Magic 8 ball.

There are four different topics users can select to get predictions: Health, Work, Education, and Relationship. The game requires the user's age and relationship status to provide relevant future predictions. Depending on the collected data, a prediction is displayed and users are given a chance to select another topic. If the user chooses not to continue playing, the game asks for the user's nickname and farewell the user with the input provided.

# Planning

## Flow Chart

In the planning stage, I used [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to create main logic flow of the game. The final version of the application has a few differences, such as when the game asks for user input or how the game reacts to those inputs. I mentioned it in more detail in the [User Input](#user-input) section.
